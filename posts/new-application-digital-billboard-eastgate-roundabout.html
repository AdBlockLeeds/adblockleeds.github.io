            <h1>Rejected application for a planning permission for a digital ad in Sheepscar, Leeds!</h1>
            <p>
                        There is a new application to the Leeds City Council to build a new hotel in LS2 on the land between
                        Eastgate Roundabout, Dyer Street And St Peters Street A61. As a part of that they plan to also put 
                        up a giant digital advertisement screen on one of the facades of the hotel. Deadline for objections
                        is on Monday, November 18th, 2019.
            </p>

            The digital screen has a of height 8.3 metres and width 4.8m

            Here is the exact location of the suggested development
            <p>
            Below are some suggestions that you could include in your comment. If you raise any of these points 
            in your objection, please do so in your own words.
            </p>
            <p>
            * This development would be a distraction to drivers and would therefore increase the risk of road
            traffic accidents. Putting a digital screen in what is already a very busy and demanding 
            setting will create unnecessary distractions for drivers and make it even more dangerous for 
            cyclists.
            * The development will waste a large amount of energy to install and maintain and will only exist 
            to perpetuate unnecessary consumption. Leeds City Council has declared climate emergency and 
            should therefore reject this development on the grounds that it is damaging, wasteful and 
            contradicting the cityâ€™s long-term objective to be carbon neutral.
            * The development should be rejected on the grounds of amenity as it will bring harm and 
            discomfort to people living and working close by.
            * The cumulative effect of developments should also be considered such as existing advertising 
            units and digital displays. There are already multiple such developments in the area, such as 
            those on Eastgate, Dyer Street and York Street (see the map below). There are also multiple new 
            developments planned to replace existing advertising units with digital displays such as those 
            outside the York bus station. Adding more digital TV-like distractions is only making an already
            cluttered area more dangerous.

                When making comments you can speak for yourself but also be an advocate for others from your 
                community that you know have been negatively affected by such developments.
