                        Here you can learn how you can object to the construction of new advertising billboards 
                        or any advertisement unit in Leeds. You can follow these steps to object to individual 
                        applications, though it is of course always encouraged to let the local council know how
                        you feel about advertisements in your area in general.
                </p>
                <p>
                Here is our guide:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Go to <a href="https://publicaccess.leeds.gov.uk/online-applications/">The Leeds
                            planning portal</a>. There you can find all applications that have been 
                            submitted to the Leeds City Council.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If you know the reference number of the application you are objecting to, you can 
                            enter it in the <strong>Search</strong> field, as shown in the image below. A 
                            reference looks generally like this: 19/06528/ADV 
                        </p>
                        <img src="https://adblockleeds.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/1st_pic.jpg?w=1024">
                        <p>
                            You can also search yourself for current applications for billboards, by typing 
                            for example <em>Advertisement</em> or <em>Advertising</em>, or search for 
                            developments in specific areas and postcode.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                                Once you have found the relevant application, go the Comments tab on top, as 
                                shown in the picture below:
                        </p>
                        <img src="https://adblockleeds.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/2nd_pic.jpg?w=1024">
                        <p>
                        You will need to log in to make a comment, where you will be asked for a name, email, password 
                        and address.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            You can then set your commenter type (most likely as Neighbour response), state 
                            that you object to the application and write a comment where you explain why:
                            According to our friends at [Adblock Bristol](), there are two legal arguments 
                            to object on:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Harm to Safety</strong> - e.g a big illuminated screen with changing
                                images would pose a danger to car drivers and others on and around the road.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Harm to amenity</strong> - this is harder to define, but it broadly 
                                means that the proposal doesnâ€™t fit with the character, feel and function of
                                the area.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            You can definitely write more if you think it is relevant, for example about the
                            energy consumption of a digital screen. It is especially worth mentioning if you
                            live in the area, how it will affect you that a new billboard is going to be 
                            built, etc. The more objections the better, so do not hesitate to share the 
                            information with other people.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                                Finally, if you want to write to your local councillors and let them know how 
                                you feel about advertisement in your area in general, you can find their 
                                contacts here.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                We are always happy to hear about your experience. Feel free to reach out whether it is with a 
                positive example of an objection that worked, or a frustration with the local planning. If anything 
                is unclear please let us know.
